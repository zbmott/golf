# Golf
Golf is a bad implementation of minigolf using Python. 
Part of the fun is that it's not very good and weird things happen.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies:
```
> pipenv install
```
3. Activate the pipenv shell and play golf:
```
> pipenv shell
> python golf.py
```

## Editing levels
`golf` comes with a bad level editor.
